## Simple viewer for an Golf OrderOfMerit
Built an SPA in HyperApp.
It uses Bulma for styling and Axios to fetch the result information.

Live deployed on AWS S3: (https://s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/ostgk/som-2019.html)

The purpose of this example was to create one more Hyperapp SPA solving some questions I hade for a [HyperApp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) project.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open the application in a moder browser [http://localhost:4000/som-2019.html](http://localhost:4000/som-2019.html)!

Any changes you make to your code will also automatically be reflected in the browser.

## Building a release

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `release` directory with your minified/rev'd assets.


## Using `serve`

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will use [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) to statically serve your app from the `release` directory.

## Credits

The basis of the counter code was mostly copied from @selfup's [hyperapp-one](https://github.com/selfup/hyperapp-one) example.
I also thank @lukeed and @jbucaran for all of the `taskr` examples, and the library itself.
